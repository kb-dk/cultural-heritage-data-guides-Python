# Guides to the Royal Danish Library's Digital Cultural Heritage


Welcome to this guide for working with the Royal Danish Library's digital cultural heritage.

This site contains scripts that you can use to programmatically explore data made available by the Royal Danish Library from the digital cultural heritage collections preserved by the library.

The possibilities for using the Royal Danish Library's data for research and teaching at universities are much greater than the examples on this site demonstrate. The examples are intended as inspiration and illustrate only a glimpse of the opportunities that the library's digital cultural heritage offers. If you are interested in obtaining data materials for use in a database-based university assignment or research project, we would be happy to hear from you at "Ask the Library" (https://www.kb.dk/spoerg-biblioteket).

Most of the content on this site consists of excerpts from larger datasets, Python scripts with examples of how to get started, as well as links to documentation and pages where you can download data.

## LOAR (Library Open Access Repository)
LOAR is a platform that the Royal Danish Library uses to publish the library's open datasets for use in research and teaching. We will continuously share new datasets on the platform. The datasets are licensed as Public Domain.

## Guides and Tutorials

### Archive for Danish Literature (ADL)

### Flora Danica
**Clean the Flora Danica dataset** - Transform messy metadata into a tidy format by renaming columns, extracting Latin names, parsing taxonomic information, and creating a clean dataset ready for analysis.

**Visualise the Flora Danicas metadata** - Create interactive visualizations of the Flora Danica collection, exploring authors, taxonomic groups, and publication patterns using Plotly.

**Change size on tiff files of Flora Danica** - Resize large TIFF image files while preserving aspect ratios, and display images in Jupyter notebooks using PIL and Matplotlib.

### Copenhagen Diplomatarium (Københavns Diplomatarium)
**Explore the kd dataset** - Analyze medieval Danish documents using text mining techniques, including frequency distributions, n-grams, and collocation analysis with NLTK.

### Trykkefrihedens Skrifter (Freedom of the Press Writings)
**Text Mining Freedom of the Press Writings** - Comprehensive text mining workflow including tokenization with regex, removal of Danish and German stopwords, word frequency analysis, filtered analysis by series and volume, and keyword-in-context (KWIC) analysis.
